      "My journey to Belur and Halebidu was like stepping into a stone poetry book. The Chennakeshava Temple at Belur left me speechless with its intricate carvings depicting scenes from the Puranas and Mahabharata. Each bracket figure of celestial maidens (Madanikas) tells a unique story through frozen dance poses. At Halebidu, the Hoysaleswara Temple's star-shaped platform and the detailed depiction of Shiva's life on its walls showcase the pinnacle of Hoysala craftsmanship. The local guide explained how each carving took years to complete, with no two designs being identical among the thousands present. The resilience of these 12th-century masterpieces against invasions and time makes them even more impressive.",
